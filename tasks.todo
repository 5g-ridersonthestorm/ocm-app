    Map tips:
        - check cordova plugin installed and keys setup
            - check keytool c:\...\.android\debug.keystore for sha1
        - check transparency on html div/elements
        - check android debug monitor for errors
        - use chrome remote device debugging to inspect running app
        - check div/element height for map as map won't initialise if not visible
